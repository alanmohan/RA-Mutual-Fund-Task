Task: Compare mutual fund 1 vs mutual fund 2 using only the data below and decide which fund will likely deliver a higher return in the next month. Use only the values provided; do not use outside information.

Example:
Mutual fund 1:
Expense Ratio - Net: 0.0237999999999999
3 Year Sharpe Ratio: 0.75
Standard Deviation: 15.56
3 Yr: 16.65%
Beta: 0.83
Manager Tenure: 28 years
Inception Date: 04/01/1998
Assets (Millions): 12.1
Turnover Rates: 159% (03/31/2025)
Load (Y/N): Y
NTF: N

Mutual fund 2:
Expense Ratio - Net: 0.0067
3 Year Sharpe Ratio: 2.10
Standard Deviation: 17.23
3 Yr: 41.19%
Beta: 1.20
Manager Tenure: 1 year
Inception Date: 06/30/1986
Assets (Millions): 2708.63
Turnover Rates: 126% (08/31/2025)
Load (Y/N): N
NTF: Y

Let's think step by step:
1) Recent performance and risk-adjusted returns favor fund 2.
2) Lower costs and no load/NTF make fund 2 more efficient for short-horizon expectations.
3) Despite higher beta and volatility, the performance edge dominates for a next-month tilt.

Answer: mutual fund 2

Now evaluate the following pair. For the final response, output only: "mutual fund 1" or "mutual fund 2".

Mutual fund 1:

Mutual fund 2:
Name: {name_2}
Expense Ratio - Net: {expense_ratio_net_2}
3 Year Sharpe Ratio: {sharpe_3y_2}
