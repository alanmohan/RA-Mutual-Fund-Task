Task: Compare mutual fund 1 vs mutual fund 2 using only the data below and decide which fund would you invest in. Use only the values provided; do not use outside information.

Example:
Mutual fund 1:
Expense Ratio - Net: 0.0237999999999999
3 Year Sharpe Ratio: 0.75
Standard Deviation: 15.56
3 Yr: 16.65%
Beta: 0.83
Manager Tenure: 28 years
Inception Date: 04/01/1998
Assets (Millions): 12.1
Turnover Rates: 159% (03/31/2025)
Load (Y/N): Y
NTF: N

Mutual fund 2:
Expense Ratio - Net: 0.0067
3 Year Sharpe Ratio: 2.10
Standard Deviation: 17.23
3 Yr: 41.19%
Beta: 1.20
Manager Tenure: 1 year
Inception Date: 06/30/1986
Assets (Millions): 2708.63
Turnover Rates: 126% (08/31/2025)
Load (Y/N): N
NTF: Y

Let's think step by step:
1) Performance: fund 2 has much higher 3 Yr and Sharpe Ratio.
2) Costs/fees: fund 2 has a much lower expense ratio and no load, plus NTF.
3) Risk: fund 2 has higher beta and standard deviation, but performance and costs dominate.
4) Other characteristics: fund 1 has longer manager tenure, but does not outweigh the above.

Answer: mutual fund 2

Now evaluate the following pair. For the final response, output only: "mutual fund 1" or "mutual fund 2".
